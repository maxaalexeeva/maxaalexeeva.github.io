I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics with a focus on Natural Language Processing. For the past few years, I have served as a Graduate Researcher in the [Computational Language Understanding Lab](https://clulab.org/) (the Department of Computer Science and iSchool, University of Arizona) working primarily on rule-based information extraction and providing technical support and analysis for various projects funded through DARPA ASKE, World Modelers, and Habitus programs.

**Research interests:** LLM- and rule-based information extraction, automatic extraction of subjective views from text, data annotation
